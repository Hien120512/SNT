      <p>Model development at RMS is more than just number crunching; it’s a blend of science and art that relies on each developer’s ability to think critically and creatively. Fieldwork provides real-world experience that enhances our judgment and intuition. That means better models, better understanding, and, ultimately, better preparation for when the next disaster strikes.</p>

      <p>In the days and weeks following the earthquake that struck Haiti in January 2010, it was impossible to fully-understand the earthquake’s impacts. How severe was the damage compared to our expectations?  Which areas suffered the most damage?</p>

      <p>There were a lot of ways researchers could try to answer these questions. At RMS, we’d been evaluating new ways to use satellite imagery to estimate damage. Satellite images were helping us generally understand the global built environment, but could they reveal what was happening on the ground, and would it be enough to really impact our understanding of the event?</p>

      <p>Within days, RMS was in Haiti with a cross-organizational team of our own engineers and other external researchers. First we volunteered to do an open-source assessment of post-event satellite images to estimate the extent of the damage. Then we started walking through rubble, systematically going building to building in our bright yellow vests and hard hats. The damage at each site was methodically captured, from the state of the building as a whole, to the small piles of crumbled mortar and bent steel rods in the columns that once held the buildings up. We did this in several affected regions and then compared the results to our satellite-based conclusions. After returning to the U.S., we shared our findings at workshops and conferences with hopes of improving satellite-based assessments in the future.</p>

      <p>Catastrophe models are hypothetical. Tragically, there are times when reality steps in. In the wake of catastrophic events, risk modelers have a chance to see how well what we’ve modeled in a computer-generated simulation matches up with what happened in the real world. While we couldn’t do anything to undo the damage in Haiti, what we learned during our event response and fieldwork could contribute to improving our models, which are part of a broader strategy to help people mitigate the effects of natural hazards in the future.</p>
