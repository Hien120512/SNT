    <h3>The <em>Opportunity</em></h3>
    <p>Even the most sophisticated models can never represent the dynamic nature and full complexity of the real world. Yet today's models are limited by technical and architectural constraints that no longer need apply. Tremendous advances in analytic and technical computing are making it possible to push beyond modeling's conventional limitations. Given the freedom of powerful next-generation computing resources, a renaissance in modeling innovation could revolutionize the way businesses use risk management to succeed.</p>
    <p>These models will be faster, more complete, and dramatically easier to run, adapt, and interpret. Supported by a robust new RMS platform, the next generation of risk management models will be fully integrated in business operations to enable truly informed business decisions based on risk exposure analysis in real time. Beyond improved and more efficient risk quantification, tomorrow's model solutions will deliver risk intelligence with the power to improve business performance.</p>

    <h3>The <em>Challenge</em></h3>
    <p>Every catastrophe reveals how much we still have to learn about risk. No single group of modelers, no matter how well resourced, can provide all the insights for such a vast and changeable environment as the world we live in.</p>
    <p>Even in developed markets where mature models already exist, there is still ample room for greater and more nuanced understanding of catastrophe. In other areas, such as Asia and developing countries, the need for a deeper understanding of risk&mdash;not only for catastrophic perils, but for a wide range of causes of loss&mdash;is increasingly urgent. As urbanization and globalization accelerate, stressing infrastructure, concentrating populations, and spawning megacities, entire regions face new and greater vulnerabilities and exposure to a wide range of interdependent and catastrophe risks. Meeting these and other challenges will require the intelligence and expertise of the entire risk modeling community.</p>

    <h3><em>Benefits</em></h3>
    <h4>More time interpreting results, less time operating the machine</h4>
    <p>Today's models are complex and weighty. They tax in-house IT capacities and tie down valuable resources better used to analyze results and gain a better understanding of what those results mean, including the uncertainties and sensitivities. Across re/insurance, financial, and modeling industries, businesses are spending too much time running models, configuring data, and supporting hardware, and not enough time analyzing and interpreting results and providing decision support.</p>
    <p>The future RMS platform will liberate businesses from the model execution treadmill, delivering significant improvements in data management, automation, and operating efficiencies so more time and resources can be engaged in creating risk intelligence and disseminating insight.</p>

    <h4>In a thriving risk ecosystem, let a thousand modelers bloom</h4>
    <p>Imagine a modeling platform offering new leading-edge software and analytics, coupled with open standards and built to the highest level of professionalism, quality, scalability, and interoperability. This platform would enable the creation and implementation of the best catastrophe and risk models, including future versions of RMS models, or models created throughout the global industry.</p>
    <p>The RMS platform will provide the necessary ecosystem to spark a renaissance in innovation. It will deliver methodologies for a new era of computing that will lead to more complete risk assessment as well as accelerate the cycle of innovation for both modelers and end-user businesses.</p>

    <h4>Tapping the potential of high-performance supercomputing in the cloud</h4>
    <p>RMS models are constantly evolving. New data, new variables, new research. Today, implementing an improved version of a model is a time-consuming and complicated undertaking for everyone, including, or even especially, those businesses running our models. This is not only unsustainable as models grow more complex, powerful, and numerous, it's inefficient and restrictive. There's a better way; all we have to do is build it, and we are building it.</p>
    <p>As we begin to make our vision of high-performance supercomputing in the cloud a reality, it is becoming clear that the benefits will go well beyond speed, ease, and flexibility. When we see a way to improve a model, we'll be able to share it immediately. Every customer will have access to the latest, most accurate, and most powerful models we can build.

    <h4>Make today's business decisions based on today's risk assessment</h4>
    <p>The new RMS platform will allow businesses to monitor their portfolios dynamically and in real time, not based on data that is weeks or months old, so capital and capacity can be efficiently deployed to the best opportunities. Eliminating this lag in information will enable more efficient management of business capacity, leading to greater returns on capital and making modeling and risk management an integral and auditable part of the core business process.</p>
    <p>No longer a separate silo, next generation modeling and risk intelligence will be efficiently embedded in the underwriting and portfolio management workflow. Truly operationalized risk management has the added benefit of satisfying the risk use-case objectives of the Board, regulators, and rating agencies.</p>

    <h3>The <em>Future</em></h3>
    <h4>Revolution, not evolution</h4>
    <p>We're at the beginning of an exciting new journey. In coming months, we'll begin to share the work we've been doing to make high-performance risk-management supercomputing in the cloud a reality for your business. Your input will be an invaluable asset in this process, and we look forward to communicating with you to make sure the next generation platform is everything you need it to be.</p>
    <p>The RMS platform will open the modeling ecosystem, operationalize risk intuition, and deliver the solutions businesses need to innovate and win in a dynamic global market. It will build on the work we've done together over the past two decades to realize its full potential. Can we build an environment where the best models have the processing power and storage they need to run efficiently, and the best modelers have the foundation they need to innovate? Can we deliver a risk management solution that leverages the power of today's leading-edge technology to transform an industry? We look forward to sharing the latest developments with you as we launch a revolutionary new era in risk management solutions.</p>
