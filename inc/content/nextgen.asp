    <h3>The <em>Opportunity</em></h3>
    <p>Risk modeling has made essential progress in the last two decades. While no model can ever fully represent the dynamic nature and complexity of the real world, today's models are highly sophisticated tools that provide a wealth of understanding and insight. And yet, we could do so much more.</p>
    <p>Critical advances in analytic and technical computing in recent years are making it possible to push beyond the conventional limitations of modeling&mdash;but only if we take a fundamental step forward together. Inspired by the potential for powerful infrastructure improvement and greater freedom of innovation, RMS is committed to helping our industry realize the benefits of advanced computing technology through an entirely new modeling and analytic platform that will tap the cloud to deliver universal high-performance computing.</p>
    <p>Enabled by next generation computing technology, tomorrow's models will be faster, more complete, and dramatically easier to run, adapt, and interpret. Supported by a new RMS platform, they'll be fully integrated in business operations to enable truly informed business decisions based on risk exposure analysis in real time. Beyond improved and more efficient risk quantification, tomorrow's solutions will deliver risk intelligence with the power to improve business performance.</p>

    <h3>The <em>Advantages</em></h3>
    <h4>More time interpreting results, less time operating the machine</h4>
    <p>Today's models are complex and weighty. They tax in-house IT capacities and tie down valuable resources better used to analyze results and gain a more nuanced understanding of what those results mean, including the uncertainties and sensitivities.</p>
    <p>The RMS platform will liberate businesses from the model execution treadmill, leveraging the cloud to deliver significant improvements in data management, automation, and operating efficiencies so more time and resources can be engaged in creating risk intelligence and disseminating insight.</p>

    <h4>Make today's decisions based on today's risk</h4>
    <p>No longer a separate silo, the RMS platform will enable modeling and risk information to be efficiently embedded in the underwriting and portfolio management workflow. Businesses will monitor their portfolios dynamically and in real time, not based on data that is weeks or months old. Eliminating this lag in information will enable more efficient management of business capital and capacity and make modeling and risk management an integral and auditable part of the core business process.</p>

    <h4>In a thriving risk ecosystem, let a thousand modelers bloom</h4>
    <p>Every major catastrophe reveals how much we still have to learn about risk. No single group of modelers, no matter how well resourced, can provide all the insights for such a vast and uncertain environment as the world we live in. Even in developed markets where more established models already exist, there remains room for more nuanced understanding of catastrophe risk. Meeting today's challenges requires the insight and expertise of the entire risk modeling community.</p>
    <p>The new platform is an open ecosystem&mdash;a platform that is open to the best, and delivers mission-critical insight at the heart of the enterprise. From catastrophe models to underwriting models, it will support our applications, your applications, and even their applications.</p>

    <h4>Supercomputing in the cloud</h4>
    <p>We realize there is no silver bullet to address every technology issue, and some may not be able to take advantage of cloud-based computing. For those that are, RMS is committed to delivering a solution with the capacity to help businesses realize the meaningful benefits of this new paradigm for computing.</p>
    <p>For those who choose to adopt it, it will mean more nimble releases from us and more cost-effective solutions for you across an ecosystem of capability.</p>
