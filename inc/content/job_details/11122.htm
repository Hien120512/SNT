      (London, United Kingdom)
    <span class="reqid">Position: 11122</span></div><div class="description">RMS is the world's leading provider of analytics and decision science solutions for the quantification and management of catastrophe risks.&nbsp; The models and consulting services of RMS are used by hundreds of insurance and reinsurance companies, hedge funds, corporations, and governments to assess a wide-range of natural and man-made perils such as - earthquake, flood, windstorm, terrorism, and disease pandemic.&nbsp; RMS continues to grow and diversify in order to service and meet the requirement of its clients through research and technology innovation and superior client service.&nbsp; The company's strength lies in its ability to use and develop the skills of its people across a wide remit of business activities.<br /><strong>&nbsp;</strong><br /><strong>Department</strong><br />The Flood Team is a part of the Model Development department within RMS London. The department has a strong emphasis on developing models for weather-related natural catastrophes, which include floods, storm surge, tropical storms, extratropical storms and convective storms.&nbsp; It consists of approximately 35 scientists with backgrounds in mathematics, meteorology, hydrology, climatology, statistics and engineering.<br />&nbsp;<br />The RMS Flood Team develops high-resolution large-scale flood models which are used to assess flood risk for the insurance business. The modelling work carried out by the flood team encompasses all steps from hazard modelling to loss modelling. &nbsp;The department has a dynamic working environment with clear scientific and technological atmosphere.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Objective of the Catastrophe Risk Modeller</strong><br />Assist in the further development of the model components (e.g., large scale modelling of stochastic rainfall processes, rainfall-runoff processes, defence failure mechanisms).&nbsp; Quality-check the intermediate results (e.g., calibration results) and final model output (e.g., flood footprints, flood losses and their spatial patterns).<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Key Accountabilities &amp; Deliverables:</strong><br />
<ul>
<li>Further &nbsp;refinement of hydrological and hydraulic modules by researching and implementing novel scientific techniques</li>
<li>Assisting in generating accurate and realistic model forcings such as stochastic rainfall and snowfall for various flood projects</li>
<li>Checking of model results (both hazard and loss data) by comparison to existing flood maps and loss benchmarks</li>
<li>Research into consistency between observed and modeled spatial patterns</li>
</ul>
<strong>Experience Required:</strong><br />
<ul>
<li>A background in hydrology, meteorology or applied mathematics at MSc or above.</li>
<li>Possess an analytical mindset and strong programming skills (e.g., Fortran, R, scripting languages)<strong> </strong></li>
<li>Experience of working on large data sets in a Linux/Unix environment.</li>
<li>Experience or knowledge of model development would be advantageous but not essential.</li>
<li>Experience of and ability to work as part of a team is essential</li>
