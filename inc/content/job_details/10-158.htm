Founded at Stanford University in 1988 and with headquarters in Newark, California, RMS offers data, models and analytics for the management of insurance catastrophe risk associated with natural perils such as earthquakes, hurricanes and windstorms for the P&amp;C insurance industry. RMS&rsquo; models and solutions are used by hundreds of insurance and reinsurance companies, hedge funds, corporations, and governments to assess a wide-range of natural and man-made perils, from earthquakes and hurricanes to terrorism and disease pandemic.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>The Opportunity</strong><br />RMS is developing solutions comprising of services, databases and analytics applications to help clients acquire, develop, analyze and manage high quality, high resolution data related to the risks they insure (geospatial and exposure data), the hazards that they are subject to (hazard data) and the losses that they risk incurring or actually experience (model loss and claims data) due to catastrophic events. These databases, data management and data analytics services and solutions are developed and delivered by multi-disciplinary product and service teams based operating under an RMS India data development group in Noida (suburb of New Delhi), India, in collaboration with teams at RMS offices around the world.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Responsibilities</strong><br />The senior engineer/engineer will be part of a small multi-disciplinary team of domain experts that will provide the necessary structural engineering and catastrophe modeling expertise required to support the development of the India based teams&rsquo; data related activities. This team will comprise of high quality engineers/modelers, who have multi-disciplinary skills, experience and expertise in areas such as structural engineering, architecture/urban planning, catastrophe model building, cat model usage, rapid inventory and exposure development (using remote sensing and other techniques), cat response/reconnaissance, disaster management, mitigation, geospatial etc. Specific responsibilities include:<br />
<ul>
<li><u>Technical content of database development</u>: involves applying the structural engineering, cat modeling, remote sensing, geospatial and other relevant domain knowledge to identify and evaluate the value of additional data sources; assess the quality aspects such as relevance and reliability of the data characteristics for its intended application; add relevant content to the databases such as construction information, building value or other risk decisioning support data..</li>
<li><u>Database development</u>: participate in, and provide oversight, review and approval of development decisions to evaluate and integrate new sources of property data, propose and design innovative development strategies that lead to the creation of robust databases in the most cost efficient manner, design innovative methods to extract useful information from unstructured data sources, optimize efficiency and cost-effectiveness of processes for data compilation based on different data acquisition techniques such as&nbsp; photo interpretation, remote sensing, and field surveys.</li>
<li><u>Quality</u>: responsibility for product quality. Develop methods for evaluating quality, provide appropriate cat modeling and structural engineering training to ensure that database product releases meet or exceeds quality expectations.</li>
<li><u>Data analytics and insight:</u> Working with data analytical services teams, provide model and engineering domain expertise required to interpret model results and deliver the services successfully, gain additional insight into clients&rsquo; exposure, losses and claims and correlations between these, and propose new services, products and solutions based on these insights</li>
</ul>
<strong>Job Requirements</strong><br />The applicant must have:<br />
<ul>
<li>Strong engineering, mathematical and statistical concepts</li>
<li>Strong communication and interpersonal skills</li>
<li>Analytical bent of mind</li>
<li>Ability to foster innovative thinking</li>
<li>Bachelors/Masters in Civil Engineering/Architecture/Construction Management or related field from a reputed university</li>
<li>Solid amount&nbsp;relevant experience</li>
