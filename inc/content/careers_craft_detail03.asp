      <p>Building the software that drives catastrophe models is a complex, multivariate problem. The work doesn’t stop with just delivering models, but perhaps more importantly extends to providing our diverse customer base with durable, flexible, purpose-built solutions that turn data visualization and analytic output into actionable insight.</p>

      <p>The analysts that use our applications work in time-critical operating environments manipulating and analyzing large volumes of multi-dimensional exposure and loss data. While there are commonalities in how different companies and users are using the software, there is also an incredibly subjective and individualized element to how information is digested and applied. Every decision that we make about how menus and buttons are built in the user interface, or how data and reports are accessed and packaged can have a profound effect on the insights our clients can derive.</p>

      <p>Finding that balance is the real art of our application design – as catastrophe modeling becomes more integral to decision making, it’s imperative that we build solutions that not only bring simplicity and accessibility to complex information, but also allow users to flexibly leverage the solution as an analytic sandbox. And to add another dimension, we need to enable users to build risk intuition through model transparency and the ability to test sensitivities for different modeling, data, or risk mitigation assumptions.</p>

      <p>Navigating all of these complexities has presented challenges, and our strategy has had to evolve with the needs of our clients and our understanding of how they use our products. To get it right, we’ve forced ourselves to completely rethink the way that we approach the user experience and visual analytics design. Our own internal assumptions and even early development work were set aside; we formed new collaborations with our clients to re-vet our concepts and approaches; we identified new best-in-class data visualization and user interface design theories.</p>

      <p>And now our developers are transforming this design work into reality. We can’t wait to see it bring meaningful changes to the way our clients understand and manage risk.</p>
