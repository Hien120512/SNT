      <p>As a software engineer, you’re usually saddled with legacy code that needs to be brought into the fold on every new initiative. You want to build something beautiful and streamline, but basically you’ve got to hook it up to the old sofas and beat up recliners you’ve collected over the years. It’s very rare to have the opportunity to start from scratch and have the freedom to build the most elegant, efficient solution possible. Most places have either ambition or resources, but you need both. You might be a startup with big dreams, but getting somebody to fund a major initiative out of the blue is tough. Or you might have the resources of an established company, but then you have an entire organization that’s deeply attached to the status quo.</p>

      <p>Two years ago, we reached a point with risk modeling where our modelers were saying, “We don’t have to use approximations. We have the real numbers. Let’s just do it right.” The problem was, nobody running these models has the processing power or data storage capacity to handle something that is going to generate a terabyte of data every time you run it. We talking about extremely large amounts of data. The models were outstripping the available infrastructure. You want to deliver the best model possible, but practically speaking nobody could run that model. What you’d need is batch processing to speed things up, massive data storage that was fast and efficient to access, and streamlined workflow to avoid bottlenecks. Well, we knew that wasn’t going to happen. You’d have to build a new framework from the ground up. You’d need an entirely new architecture! Sure, it could be done, probably, but it would be an outrageously big undertaking in terms of capital, time, resources of every sort really. This would be a very software heavy solution, and a lot of it you’d have to innovate.</p>

      <p>RMS employs a few dozen of the best software engineers working anywhere in the world today. These are guys who wait their whole careers to get their hands on this kind of a project. We looked around and knew we had to build it. That was a great day.</p>

      <p>Since then, we’ve spent two years designing a next generation risk modeling platform that is as fast, efficient, and powerful as anything available anywhere. No legacy code. We got rid of the stained plaid sofas and the beat up lounge chairs. We used best of breed mainstream technologies where it made sense and built our own leading-edge solutions where we needed innovation. It’s an exciting time as we prepare to share it with the world.</p>
